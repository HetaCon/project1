      <p class="text">I love Jubyphonic's covers and this is always going to be one of the classic JubyPhonic songs for me. I doubt it's her most listened to cover, but it's the one I listen to the most. I don't remember
        how I discovered this song but I'm willing to bet it was through an anime MMD or animatic.
        <br><br>
        I'm not really sure why but this song always has a hint of melancholy to it, but I think that's probably why it's stuck with me for so long. There's something encouraging about the lyrics because sure,
        maybe today might not be the greatest, but there's always the promise of tomorrow. The chorus has always been a reassuring affirmation for me in particular: "Taking it step by step, we'll always move ahead."
        Sometimes there's nothing to do but keep moving forward in any way possible, no matter how slow it can be
        <br><br>
        I also really love the rain and this song paints a particularly calming image, and it's often what I like to listen to when I'm taking walks on rainy days. It makes me really stop and appreciate the weather
        and just take a moment to slow down. I always feel like I have to keep moving and doing something productive so music is really the only thing that can put me into the sort of headspace that lets me observe
        the things around me without me having to rely on enforcing that intention for myself. I'm still trying to learn the dance for this song after all these years
