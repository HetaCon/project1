      <p class="text">This is probably one of my favorite games of all time, mostly because it just makes me laugh so much. I'm not very good at 
        video games so combat isn't really my marker of what makes a game enjoyable for me, and though I do tend to be drawn in by the narratives
         of games, it doesn't really need to be all that deep of a story to invest me. Really it ends up being that the characters are interesting 
         and their stories have potential even if it's never actually explored in a serious context. I think my love for The Henry Stickmin 
         Collection is the perfect example of that
        <br><br>
         Charles is my favorite character, due in large part to the fact that I recognize a lot of my experiences with ADHD in any scene he's in. 
         He's just such a silly and bubbly character but is also highly competent and one of the best in his field. I mean, I looked up the 
         mechanics and flying a helicopter is complicated, there's no way I could do that! There's something cool about a character's personality 
         not impacting their capabilities. I actually like Henry's character for a similar reason. I do find his backstory (or mysterious lack 
         thereof) interesting in terms of how he became a thief and the concept of how many different paths and moralities he's walked throughout 
         different timelines, but what I vibe with the most is the fandom's depiction of him as selectively mute. Sometimes my voice shuts down on 
         me when I get really overwhelmed so it's comforting to see a character still able to communicate and make connections even if they can't 
         talk. Henry's actually even the reason I've started to learn ASL
