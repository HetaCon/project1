      <p class="text">I don't even watch Beastars but I found this song through a Genshin animation and it's just too darn catchy, it always gets 
        stuck in my head! One of the cool things about this though is that the cover is done by CyYu who is the English voice actor for the Genshin
         character Cyno, who is my absolute favorite. I actually was already familiar with both CyYu and Jonah Scott because they both voice acted
        in a game I was really into in middle school. I will say though, I totally did not recognize Jonah's voice, it's strange not hearing him
         voicing a very soft-spoken character
        <br><br>
        This is one of those songs that just makes me feel powerful and like I can take on anything, so I always play it if I need to get amped up 
        or need to get out some energy
