      <p class="text">Every song from the Persona 5 soundtrack goes so hard but this is one of my favorites. Honestly I can never decide whether 
        I like the cinematic version or the full version of the song better, because the animation is gorgeous and so lively but more song is great.
         If I could, I think I'd prefer to have an animated version of the full song and get the best of both
        <br><br>
        The message in this song is one I really like that I think makes it stand out from some of the other songs in the soundtrack. They all are 
        talking about the idea of freeing yourself and taking back control of your life and what happens in your own story, but Colors Flying High
         in particular also has the theme of being unashamed of <em>being</em> exactly as you are and staying true to yourself and your values.
          It's been hard learning to accept myself due to my ADHD so it's always a much needed reminder that as long as I'm being myself, I can't
           go wrong
