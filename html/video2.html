      <p class="text">This song is definitely an example of the type of music I listen to if I need a distraction, though it definitely can be something I listen to because I'm feeling happy.
        It's for sure one of the peppier songs in my personal music collection which actually is a bit more of a recent development, even though I found this song all the way back in 2016 through
        an anime MMD
        <br><br>
        For a good majority of junior high and high school, the songs I listened to were often pretty depressing and not very hopeful or happy because I was struggling so much with a lot of mental
        health issues at the time, including but definitely not limited to depression. That's not to say that I'm not still having to deal with them of course, but I've made a lot of progress over
        the past several years and coming back to all of the songs I used to listen to frequently, it's interesting getting to see just how much my headspace has improved. I always loved bubbly,
        fun songs, but for a while, I didn't see much of a point in listening to them super often. It's a lot more frequent now which I'm happy about
