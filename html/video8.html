      <p class="text">I'm really not a fan of darker shows and games but Persona 5 has become an exception to that. My sister started playing it a 
        couple weeks before I left for college last year and I was very intrigued by it, though it drove me nuts that I couldn't see any more of 
        the story until I was back home because the game is only accessible on our PlayStation. She finished it by that point so I started my own 
        playthrough and whenever I go home, I spend literal hours sitting on the couch maxing out my confidant ranks and infiltrating palaces
        <br><br> 
        I still haven't finished the game though. I'll get to it eventually 
        <br><br>One of the reasons I like the game so much is because one of the characters is a very theatric artist and Yusuke is unironically 
        everything I aspire to be
