    <p class="quotes"><em>“Everyone in your generation has a short attention span” <br>
        “Every generation is just getting more ADD” <br>
        “The Internet is making us all ADHD”</em></p> <br>
        
        <p class="main-text">These are phrases that have been circulating around for a while now, as the fast pace of the internet has started to affect our expectations for 
        what we have access to. Anyone can take out their phone and look something up as soon as they start thinking of a question, anyone can go 
        online and buy groceries that get delivered to their door, anyone can log in to social media and start a conversation with someone halfway 
        across the world. It's changed our expectations, I won't deny that, but it is not because the internet is making us increasingly ADHD.</p>
        <br>
        <b><h3>What is ADHD?</h3></b>
            <p class="main-text">ADHD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder. ADHD is also sometimes still referred 
            to as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) but this is an outdated term, the disorder instead being divided into 3 subtypes or presentations: predominantly 
            hyperactive-impulsive, predominantly inattentive, and combined.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">First off, I want to address one of the biggest misconceptions about ADHD: you do not have to be a loud, energetic 8-year-old boy with 
            poor grades to have ADHD. I am a 21-year-old AFAB person who was diagnosed when I was 18, only 3 years ago after making it all the way 
            through elementary, middle, and high school with straight-A’s and honors. I was always described as being a “pleasure to have in class” 
            and that I was very interested in every subject that was taught in elementary school. I was frequently amongst the top of my class 
            continuing on into middle and high school. I took 4 AP classes my senior year of high school, and passed all of them with 3's or better.
             And yet, I was still diagnosed by a psychiatrist with combination-type ADHD and feel its effects every day.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">ADHD is not defined by gender or age. It is not defined by supposed intelligence or lack thereof, nor by personality or 
            temperament. Anyone can have ADHD, but not everyone is. The phrase "Everyone is a little ADHD" isn't true. It's possible for people to 
            have some symptoms that resemble ADHD, but that doesn't mean it is ADHD.</p>
            <br>
        <b><h3>How does ADHD work?</h3></b>
            <p class="main-text">When people say that ADHD brains are wired differently, that’s literal. It’s a neurodevelopmental disorder, a neurological disorder that
             forms in the development of the nervous system during the prenatal stage of a person’s life. Though the nervous system isn’t fully 
             developed until around the age of 25, new neurons stop being formed within the first year of a person’s life, and the basic structure 
             of the brain is in place by the time a person is born. Research has found that there are certain parts of the brain that differ between
              those with ADHD and those without, whether by size or the rate in which they mature. I won't get too deep into the details but one 
              example is that people with ADHD frequently have smaller prefrontal cortexes (the area of the brain responsible for things like 
              planning, decision making, and working memory which you will note are often things people with ADHD struggle with) than those without,
               and there are many more differences beyond that. Structural differences in how the brain's neural networks are connected as well as 
               low levels and faster reuptake of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (a neurotransmitter that plays a role in pleasure, motivation, 
               and learning) and norepinephrine (a neurotransmitter and hormone that comes from dopamine) also play a role in the presentation of 
               ADHD. Though there are mental health conditions and disorders that can develop over time as a response to environmental factors 
               (nurture rather than nature), ADHD is something you’re born with. If you have it, that means it’s always been there. Even for the 
               people diagnosed as adults, the symptoms have always been there but they weren’t recognized at the time, and many adults that go 
               undiagnosed until later in life struggled immensely but just never knew why. It is extremely unlikely for children with ADHD to "grow 
               out of" it, most of the people who do merely get better at hiding it.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">There is a lot to ADHD, it isn’t as simple as people commonly understand it. It’s not merely a lack of focus or not being able to sit 
            still. In fact, the name itself isn’t even an accurate description of what the disorder entails. It’s not that people with ADHD have an 
            attention deficit, it’s that people with ADHD have trouble regulating attention and emotions due to structural differences in the brain,
             and those aren’t the only things these structural differences affect either. A variety of symptoms exist, including but not limited to:</p>
            <br>

            <ul class="symplist">
                <li>difficulties with regulating attention, either being able to focus very little or being completely absorbed by a task (referred to as hyperfocus)</li>
                <li>difficulties with short-term memory, and the process of moving information from short to long-term memory</li>
                <li>difficulties with planning, setting long-term goals, and thinking through future consequences of current actions</li>
                <li>difficulties with conceptualizing and processing the passage of time (known as timeblindness)</li>
                <li>difficulties with completing menial or unengaging tasks, even if doing them would be beneficial in the future</li>
                <li>difficulties with maintaining good hygiene practices</li>
                <li>difficulties with forming routines and habits</li>
                <li>difficulties with emotional regulation/intense emotions</li>
                <li>restlessness and an inability to stay still for extended periods of time</li>
                <li>poorer sense of motor control such as balance and coordination</li>
                <li>disrupted sleeping patterns</li>
                <li>issues with processing sensory information such as sound</li>
                <li>greater receptibility to rejection or perceived rejection (called Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria or RSD)</li>
                <li>brief periods of intense interest in activities, hobbies, and pieces of media before suddenly being dropped and moved on from (called hyperfixations)</li>
                <li>and many more...</li>

            </ul>

            <br>

            <p class="main-text">The most common understanding of the symptoms of ADHD is still extremely reductive and there are far more areas of
                 daily life that are impacted by it than just greater distractibility and trouble sitting still. And that's not even mentioning the
                  comorbidity between ADHD and mental illnesses or other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <br>
        <b><h3>The Reality of ADHD and the Internet</h3></b>
            <p class="main-text">It is true that recently more and more people are being diagnosed with ADHD, and it is true that technology and 
                the internet is becoming more and more prominent in modern society, but the relationship between the two is correlation, not 
                causation. Studies looking into this issue have found that increased screen time can result in some ADHD-<em>like</em> symptoms but more 
                often than not, it tends to be that excessive use of the internet exacerbates the symptoms for people who already have the disorder,
                 and people with ADHD are more likely to struggle with internet addiction than neurotypicals are. And the reason that more people 
                 are being diagnosed now is because the idea of what ADHD <em>is</em> is starting to change, assisted by the destigmatization of 
                 neurodiversity and mental illnesses in general.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">In psychology, there is a concept referred to as the social model of disability which posits that disability is not 
                the result of moral failing or a medical issue to be cured but instead constructed due to the overall lack of accommodations for 
                people with disabilities in society and the inflexible expectations they are held to that don't take into account their limitations. 
                Modern society has gotten so high-speed, so energy-intensive and demanding, that it's hard for people to keep up, especially those 
                with ADHD. We're asked to split our attention in so many different directions that some of us just completely shut down because we 
                are so overwhelmed. It makes sense that people's attention is so scattered, because that's the only way we can ever hope to keep up 
                with the expectations of our fast-paced world. But it is not because the internet is making all of us ADHD.</p>
            <br>
        <b><h3>My Personal Take</h3></b>
            <p class="main-text">Honestly, I do consider myself disabled because of my ADHD, it does significantly impair my ability to do a large 
                number of things from making myself food to studying to keeping track of conversations. But there are also aspects of it that I 
                genuinely love. I love my hyperfixations, and how invested I get into different shows and video games, it's part of what inspires me 
                to make art and is the reason I chose to become an artist in the first place. I love how deeply I feel my feelings, there's something
                 so amazing about how I have the capacity for so much emotion. I love how quickly my brain makes connections because it's super 
                 useful for brainstorming ideas for my art, I love knowing random and strange little snippets of facts from so many different topics.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">My ADHD isn't something I want "cured," because there are parts of it that I would actually like to keep while also 
                trying to manage and cope with the more frustrating symptoms. And my ADHD definitely isn't because of me growing up with the internet
                 and the near endless amounts of information it holds.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">Plus, just because I have a short attention span and flit around a million different thoughts doesn't mean that what
                 captures my attention doesn't have meaning. My brain just moves quicker than I can keep up with sometimes.</p>
